    <h1 class="blue-text text-lighten-1">🦸‍♂️ Meet The Superhero!</h1>
    <hr />
    <p class="flow-text">By day: just another ordinary human who forgets where they parked their car.
        By night: a caped crusader who saves the world from chaos, bad Wi-Fi, and unmuted Zoom calls.
        Armed with bravery, sarcasm, and an unlimited snack supply, this hero proves that you don’t need laser eyes to 
        shine—sometimes all it takes is showing up with style (and maybe a cape that doesn’t get stuck in doors).</p>
